        <h2>A Story That Turns Everything Upside Down</h2>
        <p><em>Wicked</em> has completely taken over my heart this year. 
        It’s more than a movie to me, it’s a reimagining of a classic story told through new eyes. 
        We all grew up knowing the Wicked Witch of the West as the villain, but Wicked flips that idea, showing how Elphaba’s courage and compassion were misunderstood. 
        The film’s storytelling and emotional layers make it unforgettable.</p>

        <h2>The Characters and Their Friendship</h2>
        <p>One of the most powerful parts of the movie is the friendship between Elphaba and Glinda. 
        Their relationship is messy, magical, and deeply real. 
        It reminds me that people can be completely different and still change each other’s lives. 
        Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo bring so much heart and depth to their roles—it’s impossible not to root for them both.</p>

        <h2>The Music That Stays With You</h2>
        <p>Every song in Wicked feels like it was written to stay in your head forever. 
        “Defying Gravity” especially gives me chills every single time I hear it, it’s about breaking free and believing in yourself, no matter who doubts you. 
        The soundtrack alone makes the film worth watching, but paired with the stunning visuals, it becomes pure magic.</p>
